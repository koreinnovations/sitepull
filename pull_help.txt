HELP:

This script is designed to pull a production site down to a staging site or local
development server in an automated fashion. Following are command-line switches 
that can be used to modify the behavior of this script:

--download-db           Download a backup copy of the database. This flag will
                        trigger the production server to generate a new backup
                        on the fly.

--install-db            Download a backup copy of the database (see --download-db),
                        and then install it locally.

--install-db-only       Install the database locally without downloading it or any
                        of the files on the site.

--backup-local-db       Creates a backup copy of the local database prior to making
                        any changes

NOTE:
Unless you choose --install-db-only, the script will download the latest files
from the remote website. This includes modules, themes, uploaded files,
drupal core, etc.
